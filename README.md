<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3> 

Chess is a popular two-player strategy game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for centuries. With the rise of computer science and programming, it is now possible to create chess-playing programs that can compete against human players. In this project, we will explore how to create a Chess Player PRO using the Python programming language with matplotlib and numpy libraries.

<h3> BACKGROUND </h3> 

There are several libraries and frameworks available in Python that can help you build a chess-playing program. For example, the python-chess library provides a pure Python chess library with move generation, move validation, and support for common formats. This library allows you to create and manipulate chess boards, generate legal moves, and validate moves.

<h3> METHODOLOGY </h3>
  
To create a Chess Player PRO using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies, such as the python-chess library.
2. Create a working command-line chess-playing program using the python-chess library.
3. Implement an algorithm to evaluate the chess board and make decisions on the best move.
4. Use a library like Pygame to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the chess-playing program.

<h3> RESULTS </h3> 

By following these steps, you will be able to create a fully functional Chess Player PRO using Python. You can use this project to learn more about algorithms, data structures, and graphical user interfaces in Python.

<h3> CONCLUSION </h3>

In conclusion, creating a Chess Player PRO using Python is an interesting and challenging project that can help you improve your programming skills. By using libraries like python-chess and Pygame, you can easily create a working Chess Player PRO in Python.
